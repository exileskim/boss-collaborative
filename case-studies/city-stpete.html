          <h2 data-animate="fade-up">The Challenge</h2>
          <p class="text-lg" data-animate="fade-up">St. Petersburg, Florida, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the southeastern United States. With growth comes opportunity — and tension. The City needed to develop a comprehensive strategic plan that would guide investment, development, and policy decisions for the next five years. The problem wasn't a lack of vision. It was too many competing ones.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">City council members, department heads, neighborhood associations, business leaders, environmental advocates, and community organizations each brought legitimate but often conflicting priorities to the table. Previous planning efforts had produced documents that checked procedural boxes but failed to generate the genuine buy-in needed for implementation. The plans would sit on shelves, referenced in meetings but rarely driving actual decisions.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">The City's leadership knew they needed a different approach — one that didn't just gather input but actively built consensus among stakeholders who had been talking past each other for years.</p>

          <blockquote class="pull-quote" data-animate="fade-in">
            We'd done strategic planning before. What we hadn't done was get everyone in the room to actually agree on what matters most — and mean it.
            <cite>City Administrator, City of St. Petersburg</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 data-animate="fade-up">The Approach</h2>
          <p class="text-lg" data-animate="fade-up">We designed an engagement process that unfolded over four months — long enough to build trust among stakeholders, short enough to maintain momentum. The process had three phases: Listen, Align, and Commit.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up"><strong>Phase 1: Listen.</strong> We conducted 30 individual stakeholder interviews and four community listening sessions in different neighborhoods. Rather than asking people what they wanted (which tends to produce wish lists), we asked what they were worried about losing and what they believed the city couldn't afford to get wrong. This reframing shifted conversations from advocacy to shared concern.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up"><strong>Phase 2: Align.</strong> We brought 75 stakeholders together for a series of four facilitated working sessions. Each session had a specific objective. Session one surfaced and categorized the core tensions — growth vs. preservation, investment vs. affordability, development vs. environmental protection. We made the tradeoffs visible and explicit, which is where most planning processes fail by papering over real disagreements.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">Sessions two and three used structured negotiation frameworks where stakeholder groups worked across their typical alliances. A neighborhood association president and a commercial developer might share a table, each working to understand the other's constraints. We facilitated these conversations with clear ground rules, visual priority-mapping tools, and real-time synthesis so that every voice shaped the emerging consensus.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up"><strong>Phase 3: Commit.</strong> The final sessions focused on translating consensus into specifics. Working groups developed implementation roadmaps for each priority area, with clear milestones, departmental ownership, and accountability mechanisms. We facilitated the difficult conversations about resource allocation — where would funding come from, what would need to wait, and how would progress be measured?</p>

          <h2 data-animate="fade-up">The Outcome</h2>
          <p class="text-lg" data-animate="fade-up">The strategic plan that emerged was adopted unanimously by City Council — a first for a comprehensive plan in recent memory. More importantly, stakeholders who had historically been adversarial publicly endorsed the process and the resulting priorities.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">The plan identified five priority areas with specific three-year implementation timelines. Within the first year, three of the five priority areas had active implementation teams. Department heads reported that the plan was actually referenced in budget decisions and project prioritization — not because it was mandated, but because the process had created genuine ownership.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">The City subsequently adopted the facilitation methodology for two additional planning processes: a parks and recreation master plan and a transportation infrastructure review. The approach proved adaptable across policy domains because the core principle remained the same — create space for real conversation, make tradeoffs visible, and build commitment through shared authorship.</p>

          <blockquote class="pull-quote" data-animate="fade-in">
            For the first time, we have a plan that people actually feel ownership over. That's the difference between a document and a direction.
