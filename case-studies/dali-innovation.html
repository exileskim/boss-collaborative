          <h2 data-animate="fade-up">The Challenge</h2>
          <p class="text-lg" data-animate="fade-up">The Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg is one of the most significant cultural institutions in the southeastern United States. But the museum's leadership recognized a gap: their community engagement programs, while well-attended, were reaching the same audiences year after year. The neighborhoods closest to the museum — many of them underserved — felt disconnected from what was happening inside its walls.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">The museum didn't want incremental improvements. They wanted to fundamentally reimagine how their programs connected with the broader community. The challenge was complex: how do you honor an institution's artistic legacy while making it genuinely accessible to people who've never felt invited? And how do you do it in a way that's sustainable, not performative?</p>

          <blockquote class="pull-quote" data-animate="fade-in">
            We needed someone who understood both creative processes and community dynamics. This wasn't a marketing problem — it was a design challenge.
            <cite>Director of Community Programs, The Dali Museum</cite>
          </blockquote>

          <h2 data-animate="fade-up">The Approach</h2>
          <p class="text-lg" data-animate="fade-up">We began by listening. Over two weeks, we conducted interviews and focus groups with museum staff, docents, board members, local community organizations, school leaders, and — critically — residents from surrounding neighborhoods who had never visited the museum. These conversations surfaced insights that no internal planning session could have produced.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">With those insights as our foundation, we designed a series of collaborative workshops that brought these diverse voices together. We used design thinking methodology adapted for cultural contexts: empathy mapping to understand different community members' relationship with art and museums, rapid ideation to generate program concepts, and prototyping sessions where participants sketched out what new programs might actually look and feel like.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">The workshops were deliberately creative in format, drawing inspiration from Dali's own surrealist philosophy. We used visual thinking exercises, collaborative art-making as a facilitation tool, and scenario-building activities that asked participants to imagine the museum five years into the future. This wasn't a traditional strategic planning process — it was a creative collaboration that matched the institution's identity.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">Over six weeks, we facilitated four major sessions and multiple smaller working groups, progressively refining concepts from initial ideas into actionable program designs with budgets, timelines, staffing requirements, and success metrics.</p>

          <h2 data-animate="fade-up">The Outcome</h2>
          <p class="text-lg" data-animate="fade-up">The process produced five new community engagement programs, each co-designed with the communities they were meant to serve. Three launched within six months of the engagement.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">The results exceeded expectations. Within the first year, community participation in museum programming increased by 35%. More importantly, the demographic composition of program participants shifted meaningfully — the museum was reaching neighborhoods and populations that had historically been underrepresented in their visitor data.</p>
          <p data-animate="fade-up">Two of the programs were recognized by regional arts organizations as innovative models for museum-community partnership. The museum's team reported that the design process itself had changed their internal culture — staff across departments had adopted collaborative design practices in their own planning work.</p>

          <blockquote class="pull-quote" data-animate="fade-in">
            The programs we created together didn't just increase attendance numbers — they changed who sees this museum as theirs. That's the impact that matters.
